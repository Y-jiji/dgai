**DGAI** is a novel on-disk graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search system designed for large-scale, dynamic vector datasets. 

Unlike traditional coupled architectures, DGAI separates the lightweight graph topology from heavyweight vector data. This decoupled design, combined with a specialized three-stage query strategy and incremental similarity-aware reordering, significantly reduces I/O overhead, delivering state-of-the-art performance for both high-throughput updates and low-latency queries. Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed by 8.17x for insertions and 8.16x for deletions, while the three-stage query and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.57x compared to the traditional coupled architecture.
